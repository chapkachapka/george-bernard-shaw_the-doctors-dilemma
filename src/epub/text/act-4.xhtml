			<h2>Act IV</h2>
			<scene>The studio. The easel is pushed back to the wall. Cardinal Death, holding his scythe and hour-glass like a sceptre and globe, sits on the throne. On the hat-stand hang the hats of Sir Patrick and Bloomfield Bonington. Walpole, just come in, is hanging up his beside them. There is a knock. He opens the door and finds Ridgeon there.</scene>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Hallo, Ridgeon!</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>They come into the middle of the room together, taking off their gloves.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Whats the matter! Have you been sent for, too?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>We’ve all been sent for. I’ve only just come: I haven’t seen him yet. The charwoman says that old Paddy Cullen has been here with B. B. for the last half-hour. <sd>Sir Patrick, with bad news in his face, enters from the inner room.</sd> Well: whats up?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Go in and see. B. B. is in there with him.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Walpole goes. Ridgeon is about to follow him; but Sir Patrick stops him with a look.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>What has happened?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Do you remember Jane Marsh’s arm?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Is that whats happened?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Thats whats happened. His lung has gone like Jane’s arm. I never saw such a case. He has got through three months galloping consumption in three days.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>B. B. got in on the negative phase.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Negative or positive, the lad’s done for. He won’t last out the afternoon. He’ll go suddenly: I’ve often seen it.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>So long as he goes before his wife finds him out, I don’t care. I fully expected this.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Drily.</sd> It’s a little hard on a lad to be killed because his wife has too high an opinion of him. Fortunately few of us are in any danger of that.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Sir Ralph comes from the inner room and hastens between them, humanely concerned, but professionally elate and communicative.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech>Ah, here you are, Ridgeon. Paddy’s told you, of course.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Yes.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech>It’s an enormously interesting case. You know, Colly, by Jupiter, if I didn’t know as a matter of scientific fact that I’d been stimulating the phagocytes, I should say I’d been stimulating the other things. What is the explanation of it, Sir Patrick? How do you account for it, Ridgeon? Have we over-stimulated the phagocytes? Have they not only eaten up the bacilli, but attacked and destroyed the red corpuscles as well? a possibility suggested by the patient’s pallor. Nay, have they finally begun to prey on the lungs themselves? Or on one another? I shall write a paper about this case.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Walpole comes back, very serious, even shocked. He comes between B. B. and Ridgeon.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Whew! B. B.: youve done it this time.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech>What do you mean?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Killed him. The worst case of neglected blood-poisoning I ever saw. It’s too late now to do anything. He’d die under the anaesthetic.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech><sd>offended</sd> Killed! Really, Walpole, if your monomania were not well known, I should take such an expession very seriously.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Come come! When youve both killed as many people as I have in my time you’ll feel humble enough about it. Come and look at him, Colly.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Ridgeon and Sir Patrick go into the inner room.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>I apologize, B. B. But it’s blood-poisoning.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech><sd>recovering his irresistible good nature</sd> My dear Walpole, everything is blood-poisoning. But upon my soul, I shall not use any of that stuff of Ridgeon’s again. What made me so sensitive about what you said just now is that, strictly between ourselves, Ridgeon cooked our young friend’s goose.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Jennifer, worried and distressed, but always gentle, comes between them from the inner room. She wears a nurse’s apron.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Sir Ralph: what am I to do? That man who insisted on seeing me, and sent in word that business was important to Louis, is a newspaper man. A paragraph appeared in the paper this morning saying that Louis is seriously ill; and this man wants to interview him about it. How can people be so brutally callous?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Moving vengefully towards the door.</sd> You just leave me to deal with him!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Stopping him.</sd> But Louis insists on seeing him: he almost began to cry about it. And he says he can’t bear his room any longer. He says he wants to <sd>she struggles with a sob</sd>⁠—to die in his studio. Sir Patrick says let him have his way: it can do no harm. What shall we do?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>b b</speaker>
				<speech><sd>encouragingly</sd> Why, follow Sir Patrick’s excellent advice, of course. As he says, it can do him no harm; and it will no doubt do him good⁠—a great deal of good. He will be much the better for it.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>A little cheered</sd> Will you bring the man up here, Mr. Walpole, and tell him that he may see Louis, but that he mustn’t exhaust him by talking? <sd>Walpole nods and goes out by the outer door.</sd> Sir Ralph, don’t be angry with me; but Louis will die if he stays here. I must take him to Cornwall. He will recover there.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech><sd>brightening wonderfully, as if Dubedat were already saved</sd> Cornwall! The very place for him! Wonderful for the lungs. Stupid of me not to think of it before. You are his best physician after all, dear lady. An inspiration! Cornwall: of course, yes, yes, yes.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Comforted and touched.</sd> You are so kind, Sir Ralph. But don’t give me much or I shall cry; and Louis can’t bear that.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech><sd>gently putting his protecting arm round her shoulders</sd> Then let us come back to him and help to carry him in. Cornwall! of course, of course. The very thing! <sd>They go together into the bedroom.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Walpole returns with The Newspaper Man, a cheerful, affable young man who is disabled for ordinary business pursuits by a congenital erroneousness which renders him incapable of describing accurately anything he sees, or understanding or reporting accurately anything he hears. As the only employment in which these defects do not matter is journalism (for a newspaper, not having to act on its description and reports, but only to sell them to idly curious people, has nothing but honor to lose by inaccuracy and unveracity), he has perforce become a journalist, and has to keep up an air of high spirits through a daily struggle with his own illiteracy and the precariousness of his employment. He has a note-book, and occasionally attempts to make a note; but as he cannot write shorthand, and does not write with ease in any hand, he generally gives it up as a bad job before he succeeds in finishing a sentence.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Looking round and making indecisive attempts at notes.</sd> This is the studio, I suppose.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Yes.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Wittily.</sd> Where he has his models, eh?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Grimly irresponsive.</sd> No doubt.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech>Cubicle, you said it was?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, tubercle.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech>Which way do you spell it: is it c-u-b-i-c-a-l or c-l-e?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Tubercle, man, not cubical. <sd>Spelling it for him</sd> T-u-b-e-r-c-l-e.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech>Oh! tubercle. Some disease, I suppose. I thought he had consumption. Are you one of the family or the doctor?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>I’m neither one nor the other. I am Mister Cutler Walpole. Put that down. Then put down Sir Colenso Ridgeon.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech>Pigeon?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Ridgeon. <sd>Contemptuously snatching his book</sd> Here: you’d better let me write the names down for you: you’re sure to get them wrong. That comes of belonging to an illiterate profession, with no qualifications and no public register. <sd>He writes the particulars.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, I say: you have got your knife into us, haven’t you?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Vindictively</sd> I wish I had: I’d make a better man of you. Now attend. <sd>Shewing him the book</sd> These are the names of the three doctors. This is the patient. This is the address. This is the name of the disease. <sd>He shuts the book with a snap which makes the journalist blink, and returns it to him.</sd> Mr. Dubedat will be brought in here presently. He wants to see you because he doesn’t know how bad he is. We’ll allow you to wait a few minutes to humor him; but if you talk to him, out you go. He may die at any moment.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Interested</sd> Is he as bad as that? I say: I am in luck to-day. Would you mind letting me photograph you? <sd>He produces a camera.</sd> Could you have a lancet or something in your hand?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Put it up. If you want my photograph you can get it in Baker Street in any of the series of celebrities.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech>But they’ll want to be paid. If you wouldn’t mind <sd>fingering the camera</sd>⁠—?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>I would. Put it up, I tell you. Sit down there and be quiet.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>The Newspaper Man quickly sits down on the piano stool as Dubedat, in an invalid’s chair, is wheeled in by Mrs. Dubedat and Sir Ralph. They place the chair between the dais and the sofa, where the easel stood before. Louis is not changed as a robust man would be; and he is not scared. His eyes look larger; and he is so weak physically that he can hardly move, lying on his cushions, with complete languor; but his mind is active; it is making the most of his condition, finding voluptuousness in languor and drama in death. They are all impressed, in spite of themselves, except Ridgeon, who is implacable. B.B. is entirely sympathetic and forgiving. Ridgeon follows the chair with a tray of milk and stimulants. Sir Patrick, who accompanies him, takes the tea-table from the corner and places it behind the chair for the tray. B. B. takes the easel chair and places it for Jennifer at Dubedat’s side, next the dais, from which the lay figure ogles the dying artist. B. B. then returns to Dubedat’s left. Jennifer sits. Walpole sits down on the edge of the dais. Ridgeon stands near him.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Blissfully.</sd> Thats happiness! To be in a studio! Happiness!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, dear. Sir Patrick says you may stay here as long as you like.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Jennifer.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, my darling.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Is the newspaper man here?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Glibly.</sd> Yes, Mr. Dubedat: I’m here, at your service. I represent the press. I thought you might like to let us have a few words about⁠—about⁠—er⁠—well, a few words on your illness, and your plans for the season.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>My plans for the season are very simple. I’m going to die.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Tortured.</sd> Louis⁠—dearest⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>My darling: I’m very weak and tired. Don’t put on me the horrible strain of pretending that I don’t know. I’ve been lying there listening to the doctors⁠—laughing to myself. They know. Dearest: don’t cry. It makes you ugly; and I can’t bear that. <sd>She dries her eyes and recovers herself with a proud effort.</sd> I want you to promise me something.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, yes: you know I will. <sd>Imploringly</sd> Only, my love, my love, don’t talk: it will waste your strength.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>No: it will only use it up. Ridgeon: give me something to keep me going for a few minutes⁠—one of your confounded anti-toxins, if you don’t mind. I have some things to say before I go.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Looking at Sir Patrick</sd> I suppose it can do no harm? <sd>He pours out some spirit, and is about to add soda water when Sir Patrick corrects him.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>In milk. Don’t set him coughing.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>After drinking.</sd> Jennifer.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, dear.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>If theres one thing I hate more than another, it’s a widow. Promise me that you’ll never be a widow.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>My dear, what do you mean?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>I want you to look beautiful. I want people to see in your eyes that you were married to me. The people in Italy used to point at Dante and say “There goes the man who has been in hell.” I want them to point at you and say “There goes a woman who has been in heaven.” It has been heaven, darling, hasn’t it⁠—sometimes?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Oh yes, yes. Always, always.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>If you wear black and cry, people will say “Look at that miserable woman: her husband made her miserable.”</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>No, never. You are the light and the blessing of my life. I never lived until I knew you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>His eyes glistening.</sd> Then you must always wear beautiful dresses and splendid magic jewels. Think of all the wonderful pictures I shall never paint.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line><sd>She wins a terrible victory over a sob</sd> Well, you must be transfigured with all the beauty of those pictures. Men must get such dreams from seeing you as they never could get from any daubing with paints and brushes. Painters must paint you as they never painted any mortal woman before. There must be a great tradition of beauty, a great atmosphere of wonder and romance. That is what men must always think of when they think of me. That is the sort of immortality I want. You can make that for me, Jennifer. There are lots of things you don’t understand that every woman in the street understands; but you can understand that and do it as nobody else can. Promise me that immortality. Promise me you will not make a little hell of crape and crying and undertaker’s horrors and withering flowers and all that vulgar rubbish.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>I promise. But all that is far off, dear. You are to come to Cornwall with me and get well. Sir Ralph says so.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Poor old B. B.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech><sd>affected to tears, turns away and whispers to Sir Patrick</sd> Poor fellow! Brain going.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Sir Patrick’s there, isn’t he?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, yes. I’m here.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Sit down, won’t you? It’s a shame to keep you standing about.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, Yes. Thank you. All right.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Jennifer.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, dear.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With a strange look of delight.</sd> Do you remember the burning bush?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, Yes. Oh, my dear, how it strains my heart to remember it now!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Does it? It fills me with joy. Tell them about it.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>It was nothing⁠—only that once in my old Cornish home we lit the first fire of the winter; and when we looked through the window we saw the flames dancing in a bush in the garden.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Such a color! Garnet color. Waving like silk. Liquid lovely flame flowing up through the bay leaves, and not burning them. Well, I shall be a flame like that. I’m sorry to disappoint the poor little worms; but the last of me shall be the flame in the burning bush. Whenever you see the flame, Jennifer, that will be me. Promise me that I shall be burnt.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, if I might be with you, Louis!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>No: you must always be in the garden when the bush flames. You are my hold on the world: you are my immortality. Promise.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>I’m listening. I shall not forget. You know that I promise.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Well, thats about all; except that you are to hang my pictures at the one-man show. I can trust your eye. You won’t let anyone else touch them.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>You can trust me.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Then theres nothing more to worry about, is there? Give me some more of that milk. I’m fearfully tired; but if I stop talking I shan’t begin again. <sd>Sir Ralph gives him a drink. He takes it and looks up quaintly.</sd> I say, B. B., do you think anything would stop you talking?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech><sd>almost unmanned</sd> He confuses me with you, Paddy. Poor fellow! Poor fellow!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Musing.</sd> I used to be awfully afraid of death; but now it’s come I have no fear; and I’m perfectly happy. Jennifer.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, dear?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>I’ll tell you a secret. I used to think that our marriage was all an affectation, and that I’d break loose and run away some day. But now that I’m going to be broken loose whether I like it or not, I’m perfectly fond of you, and perfectly satisfied because I’m going to live as part of you and not as my troublesome self.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Heartbroken.</sd> Stay with me, Louis. Oh, don’t leave me, dearest.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Not that I’m selfish. With all my faults I don’t think I’ve ever been really selfish. No artist can: Art is too large for that. You will marry again, Jennifer.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, how can you, Louis?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Insisting childishly.</sd> Yes, because people who have found marriage happy always marry again. Ah, I shan’t be jealous. <sd>Slyly.</sd> But don’t talk to the other fellow too much about me: he won’t like it. <sd>Almost chuckling</sd> I shall be your lover all the time; but it will be a secret from him, poor devil!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Come! youve talked enough. Try to rest awhile.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Wearily.</sd> Yes: I’m fearfully tired; but I shall have a long rest presently. I have something to say to you fellows. You’re all there, arn’t you? I’m too weak to see anything but Jennifer’s bosom. That promises rest.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>We are all here.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Startled.</sd> That voice sounded devilish. Take care, Ridgeon: my ears hear things that other people’s can’t. I’ve been thinking⁠—thinking. I’m cleverer than you imagine.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Whispering to Ridgeon.</sd> Youve got on his nerves, Colly. Slip out quietly.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Apart to Sir Patrick.</sd> Would you deprive the dying actor of his audience?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>His face lighting up faintly with mischievous glee.</sd> I heard that, Ridgeon. That was good. Jennifer dear: be kind to Ridgeon always; because he was the last man who amused me.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Relentless.</sd> Was I?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>But it’s not true. It’s you who are still on the stage. I’m half way home already.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>To Ridgeon.</sd> What did you say?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Answering for him.</sd> Nothing, dear. Only one of those little secrets that men keep among themselves. Well, all you chaps have thought pretty hard things of me, and said them.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech><sd>quite overcome</sd> No, no, Dubedat. Not at all.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, you have. I know what you all think of me. Don’t imagine I’m sore about it. I forgive you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Involuntarily.</sd> Well, damn me! <sd>Ashamed</sd> I beg your pardon.</speech>
			</line>

				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>That was old Walpole, I know. Don’t grieve, Walpole. I’m perfectly happy. I’m not in pain. I don’t want to live. I’ve escaped from myself. I’m in heaven, immortal in the heart of my beautiful Jennifer. I’m not afraid, and not ashamed. <sd>Reflectively, puzzling it out for himself weakly</sd> I know that in an accidental sort of way, struggling through the unreal part of life, I haven’t always been able to live up to my ideal. But in my own real world I have never done anything wrong, never denied my faith, never been untrue to myself. I’ve been threatened and blackmailed and insulted and starved. But I’ve played the game. I’ve fought the good fight. And now it’s all over, theres an indescribable peace. <sd>He feebly folds his hands and utters his creed</sd> I believe in Michael Angelo, Velasquez, and Rembrandt; in the might of design, the mystery of color, the redemption of all things by Beauty everlasting, and the message of Art that has made these hands blessed. Amen. Amen. <sd>He closes his eyes and lies still.</sd></speech>

				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Breathless.</sd> Louis: are you⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Walpole rises and comes quickly to see whether he is dead.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Not yet, dear. Very nearly, but not yet. I should like to rest my head on your bosom; only it would tire you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>No, no, no, darling: how could you tire me? <sd>She lifts him so that he lies on her bosom.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Thats good. Thats real.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Don’t spare me, dear. Indeed, indeed you will not tire me. Lean on me with all your weight.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With a sudden half return of his normal strength and comfort</sd> Jinny Gwinny: I think I shall recover after all. <sd>Sir Patrick looks significantly at Ridgeon, mutely warning him that this is the end.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Hopefully.</sd> Yes, yes: you shall.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Louis</speaker>
				<speech>Because I suddenly want to sleep. Just an ordinary sleep.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Rocking him</sd> Yes, dear. Sleep. <sd>He seems to go to sleep. Walpole makes another movement. She protests.</sd> Sh⁠—sh: please don’t disturb him. <sd>His lips move.</sd> What did you say, dear? <sd>In great distress</sd> I can’t listen without moving him. <sd>His lips move again; Walpole bends down and listens.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>He wants to know is the newspaper man here.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Excited; for he has been enjoying himself enormously.</sd> Yes, Mr. Dubedat. Here I am.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Walpole raises his hand warningly to silence him. Sir Ralph sits down quietly on the sofa and frankly buries his face in his handkerchief.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With great relief.</sd> Oh thats right, dear: don’t spare me: lean with all your weight on me. Now you are really resting.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Sir Patrick quickly comes forward and feels Louis’s pulse; then takes him by the shoulders.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Let me put him back on the pillow, maam. He will be better so.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Piteously.</sd> Oh no, please, please, doctor. He is not tiring me; and he will be so hurt when he wakes if he finds I have put him away.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>He will never wake again. <sd>He takes the body from her and replaces it in the chair. Ridgeon, unmoved, lets down the back and makes a bier of it.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Who has unexpectedly sprung to her feet, and stands dry-eyed and stately.</sd> Was that death?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Yes.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With complete dignity</sd> Will you wait for me a moment? I will come back. <sd>She goes out.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Ought we to follow her? Is she in her right senses?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With quiet conviction.</sd> Yes. Shes all right. Leave her alone. She’ll come back.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Callously.</sd> Let us get this thing out of the way before she comes.</speech>

				<speech>
					<verse>
						<verse-line>Aye! that is how the wicked die.</verse-line>
						<verse-line>For there are no bands in their death;</verse-line>
						<verse-line>But their strength is firm:</verse-line>
						<verse-line>They are not in trouble as other men.</verse-line>
						<verse-line>No matter: its not for us to judge.</verse-line>

				<speech>Borrowing his first five-pound note there, probably.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>I said the other day that the most tragic thing in the world is a sick doctor. I was wrong. The most tragic thing in the world is a man of genius who is not also a man of honor.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Ridgeon and Walpole wheel the chair into the recess.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech><sd>To Sir Ralph.</sd> I thought it shewed a very nice feeling, his being so particular about his wife going into proper mourning for him and making her promise never to marry again.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech><sd>impressively</sd> Mrs. Dubedat is not in a position to carry the interview any further. Neither are we.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Good afternoon to you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech>Mrs. Dubedat said she was coming back.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech>After you have gone.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech>Do you think she would give me a few words on How It Feels to be a Widow? Rather a good title for an article, isn’t it?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech>Young man: if you wait until Mrs. Dubedat comes back, you will be able to write an article on How It Feels to be Turned Out of the House.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Unconvinced.</sd> You think she’d rather not⁠—</speech>

				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech><sd>cutting him short</sd> Good day to you. <sd>Giving him a visiting-card</sd> Mind you get my name correctly. Good day.</speech>

				<speaker>The Newspaper Man</speaker>
				<speech>Good day. Thank you. <sd>Vaguely trying to read the card</sd> Mr.⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech>No, not Mister. This is your hat, I think <sd>giving it to him.</sd> Gloves? No, of course: no gloves. Good day to you. <sd>He edges him out at last; shuts the door on him; and returns to Sir Patrick as Ridgeon and Walpole come back from the recess, Walpole crossing the room to the hat-stand, and Ridgeon coming between Sir Ralph and Sir Patrick.</sd> Poor fellow! Poor young fellow! How well he died! I feel a better man, really.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>When you’re as old as I am, you’ll know that it matters very little how a man dies. What matters is, how he lives. Every fool that runs his nose against a bullet is a hero nowadays, because he dies for his country. Why don’t he live for it to some purpose?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech>No, please, Paddy: don’t be hard on the poor lad. Not now, not now. After all, was he so bad? He had only two failings: money and women. Well, let us be honest. Tell the truth, Paddy. Don’t be hypocritical, Ridgeon. Throw off the mask, Walpole. Are these two matters so well arranged at present that a disregard of the usual arrangements indicates real depravity?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>I don’t mind his disregarding the usual arrangements. Confound the usual arrangements! To a man of science they’re beneath contempt both as to money and women. What I mind is his disregarding everything except his own pocket and his own fancy. He didn’t disregard the usual arrangements when they paid him. Did he give us his pictures for nothing? Do you suppose he’d have hesitated to blackmail me if I’d compromised myself with his wife? Not he.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>Don’t waste your time wrangling over him. A blackguard’s a blackguard; an honest man’s an honest man; and neither of them will ever be at a loss for a religion or a morality to prove that their ways are the right ways. It’s the same with nations, the same with professions, the same all the world over and always will be.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
				<speech>
					<prose>Ah, well, perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. Still, de mortuis nil nisi bonum. He died extremely well, remarkably well. He has set us an example: let us endeavor to follow it rather than harp on the weaknesses that have perished with him. I think it is Shakespear who says that the good that most men do lives after them: the evil lies interred with their bones. Yes: interred with their bones. Believe me, Paddy, we are all mortal. It is the common lot, Ridgeon. Say what you will, Walpole, Nature’s debt must be paid. If ’tis not to-day, twill be to-morrow.</prose>
					<verse>
						<verse-line>To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow</verse-line>
						<verse-line>After life’s fitful fever they sleep well</verse-line>
						<verse-line>And like this insubstantial bourne from which</verse-line>
						<verse-line>No traveller returns</verse-line>
						<verse-line>Leave not a wrack behind.</verse-line>
					</verse>
					<prose>
						<sd-line>Walpole is about to speak, but B. B., suddenly and vehemently proceeding, extinguishes him.</sd-line>
					</prose>
					<verse>
						<verse-line>Out, out, brief candle:</verse-line>
						<verse-line>For nothing canst thou to damnation add</verse-line>
						<verse-line>The readiness is all.</verse-line>
					</verse>
				</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Gently; for B. B.’s feeling, absurdly expressed as it is, is too sincere and humane to be ridiculed.</sd> Yes, B. B. Death makes people go on like that. I don’t know why it should; but it does. By the way, what are we going to do? Ought we to clear out; or had we better wait and see whether Mrs. Dubedat will come back?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech>I think we’d better go. We can tell the charwoman what to do.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>They take their hats and go to the door.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Coming from the inner door wonderfully and beautifully dressed, and radiant, carrying a great piece of purple silk, handsomely embroidered, over her arm.</sd> I’m so sorry to have kept you waiting.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>amazed, all together in a confused murmur</sd-line>
			<together>
				<line>
					<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
					<speech>Don’t mention it, madam.</speech>

				<line>
					<speaker>B. B.</speaker>
					<speech>Not at all, not at all.</speech>

				</line>
			</together>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech><sd>coming to them</sd> I felt that I must shake hands with his friends once before we part to-day. We have shared together a great privilege and a great happiness. I don’t think we can ever think of ourselves ordinary people again. We have had a wonderful experience; and that gives us a common faith, a common ideal, that nobody else can quite have. Life will always be beautiful to us: death will always be beautiful to us. May we shake hands on that?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Sir Patrick</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Shaking hands.</sd> Remember: all letters had better be left to your solicitor. Let him open everything and settle everything. Thats the law, you know.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Mrs. Dubedat</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, thank you: I didn’t know. <sd>Sir Patrick goes.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Walpole</speaker>
				<speech>Good-bye. I blame myself: I should have insisted on operating. <sd>He goes.</sd></speech>
			</line>

				<speaker>B. B.</speaker>

			<h2>Act V</h2>
			<scene>One of the smaller Bond Street Picture Galleries. The entrance is from a picture shop. Nearly in the middle of the gallery there is a writing-table, at which the Secretary, fashionably dressed, sits with his back to the entrance, correcting catalogue proofs. Some copies of a new book are on the desk, also the Secretary’s shining hat and a couple of magnifying glasses. At the side, on his left, a little behind him, is a small door marked <i>Private</i>. Near the same side is a cushioned bench parallel to the walls, which are covered with Dubedat’s works. Two screens, also covered with drawings, stand near the corners right and left of the entrance.</scene>
			<sd-line>Jennifer, beautifully dressed and apparently very happy and prosperous, comes into the gallery through the private door.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>Have the catalogues come yet, Mr. Danby?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Secretary</speaker>
				<speech>Not yet.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>What a shame! It’s a quarter past: the private view will begin in less than half an hour.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Secretary</speaker>
				<speech>I think I’d better run over to the printers to hurry them up.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, if you would be so good, Mr. Danby. I’ll take your place while you’re away.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Secretary</speaker>
				<speech>If anyone should come before the time don’t take any notice. The commissionaire won’t let anyone through unless he knows him. We have a few people who like to come before the crowd⁠—people who really buy; and of course we’re glad to see them. Have you seen the notices in Brush and Crayon and in The Easel?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Indignantly.</sd> Yes: most disgraceful. They write quite patronizingly, as if they were Mr. Dubedat’s superiors. After all the cigars and sandwiches they had from us on the press day, and all they drank, I really think it is infamous that they should write like that. I hope you have not sent them tickets for to-day.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Secretary</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, they won’t come again: theres no lunch to-day. The advance copies of your book have come. <sd>He indicates the new books.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Pouncing on a copy, wildly excited</sd> Give it to me. Oh! excuse me a moment <sd>she runs away with it through the private door.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>The Secretary takes a mirror from his drawer and smartens himself before going out. Ridgeon comes in.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Good morning. May I look round, as well, before the doors open?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Secretary</speaker>
				<speech>Certainly, Sir Colenso. I’m sorry catalogues have not come: I’m just going to see about them. Heres my own list, if you don’t mind.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Thanks. Whats this? <sd>He takes up one the new books.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Secretary</speaker>
				<speech>Thats just come in. An advance copy of Mrs. Dubedat’s Life of her late husband.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Reading the title</sd> The Story of a King By His Wife. <sd>He looks at the portrait frontise.</sd> Ay: there he is. You knew him here, I suppose.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Secretary</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, we knew him. Better than she did, Sir Colenso, in some ways, perhaps.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>So did I. <sd>They look significantly at one another.</sd> I’ll take a look round.</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>The Secretary puts on the shining hat and goes out. Ridgeon begins looking at the pictures. Presently he comes back to the table for a magnifying glass, and scrutinizes a drawing very closely. He sighs; shakes his head, as if constrained to admit the extraordinary fascination and merit of the work; then marks the Secretary’s list. Proceeding with his survey, he disappears behind the screen. Jennifer comes back with her book. A look round satisfies her that she is alone. She seats herself at the table and admires the memoir⁠—her first printed book⁠—to her heart’s content. Ridgeon re-appears, face to the wall, scrutinizing the drawings. After using his glass again, he steps back to get a more distant view of one of the larger pictures. She hastily closes the book at the sound; looks round; recognizes him; and stares, petrified. He takes a further step back which brings him nearer to her.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Shaking his head as before, ejaculates</sd> Clever brute! <sd>She flushes as though he had struck her. He turns to put the glass down on the desk, and finds himself face to face with her intent gaze.</sd> I beg your pardon. I thought I was alone.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Controlling herself, and speaking steadily and meaningly.</sd> I am glad we have met, Sir Colenso Ridgeon. I met Dr. Blenkinsop yesterday. I congratulate you on a wonderful cure.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>
					<sd>Can find no words; makes an embarrassed gesture of assent after a moment’s silence, and puts down the glass and the Secretary’s list on the table.</sd>
				</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>He looked the picture of health and strength and prosperity. <sd>She looks for a moment at the walls, contrasting Blenkinsop’s fortune with the artist’s fate.</sd></speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>In low tones, still embarrassed.</sd> He has been fortunate.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>Very fortunate. His life has been spared.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>I mean that he has been made a Medical Officer of Health. He cured the Chairman of the Borough Council very successfully.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>With your medicines?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>No. I believe it was with a pound of ripe greengages.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With deep gravity.</sd> Funny!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Yes. Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>Dr. Blenkinsop said one very strange thing to me.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>What was that?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>He said that private practice in medicine ought to be put down by law. When I asked him why, he said that private doctors were ignorant licensed murderers.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>That is what the public doctor always thinks of the private doctor. Well, Blenkinsop ought to know. He was a private doctor long enough himself. Come! you have talked at me long enough. Talk to me. You have something to reproach me with. There is reproach in your face, in your voice: you are full of it. Out with it.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>It is too late for reproaches now. When I turned and saw you just now, I wondered how you could come here coolly to look at his pictures. You answered the question. To you, he was only a clever brute.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Quivering.</sd> Oh, don’t. You know I did not know you were here.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Raising her head a little with a quite gentle impulse of pride.</sd> You think it only mattered because I heard it. As if it could touch me, or touch him! Don’t you see that what is really dreadful is that to you living things have no souls.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With a sceptical shrug.</sd> The soul is an organ I have not come across in the course of my anatomical work.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>You know you would not dare to say such a silly thing as that to anybody but a woman whose mind you despise. If you dissected me you could not find my conscience. Do you think I have got none?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>I have met people who had none.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>Clever brutes? Do you know, doctor, that some of the dearest and most faithful friends I ever had were only brutes! You would have vivisected them. The dearest and greatest of all my friends had a sort of beauty and affectionateness that only animals have. I hope you may never feel what I felt when I had to put him into the hands of men who defend the torture of animals because they are only brutes.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Well, did you find us so very cruel, after all? They tell me that though you have dropped me, you stay for weeks with the Bloomfield Boningtons and the Walpoles. I think it must be true, because they never mention you to me now.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>The animals in Sir Ralph’s house are like spoiled children. When Mr. Walpole had to take a splinter out of the mastiff’s paw, I had to hold the poor dog myself; and Mr. Walpole had to turn Sir Ralph out of the room. And Mrs. Walpole has to tell the gardener not to kill wasps when Mr. Walpole is looking. But there are doctors who are naturally cruel; and there are others who get used to cruelty and are callous about it. They blind themselves to the souls of animals; and that blinds them to the souls of men and women. You made a dreadful mistake about Louis; but you would not have made it if you had not trained yourself to make the same mistake about dogs. You saw nothing in them but dumb brutes; and so you could see nothing in him but a clever brute.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With sudden resolution.</sd> I made no mistake whatever about him.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, doctor!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Obstinately.</sd> I made no mistake whatever about him.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>Have you forgotten that he died?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With a sweep of his hand towards the pictures.</sd> He is not dead. He is there. <sd>Taking up the book</sd> And there.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Springing up with blazing eyes.</sd> Put that down. How dare you touch it?</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>Ridgeon, amazed at the fierceness of the outburst, puts it down with a deprecatory shrug. She takes it up and looks at it as if he had profaned a relic.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>I am very sorry. I see I had better go.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Putting the book down.</sd> I beg your pardon. I forgot myself. But it is not yet⁠—it is a private copy.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>But for me it would have been a very different book.</speech>
			</line>

				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>But for you it would have been a longer one.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>You know then that I killed him?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Suddenly moved and softened.</sd> Oh, doctor, if you acknowledge that⁠—if you have confessed it to yourself⁠—if you realize what you have done, then there is forgiveness. I trusted in your strength instinctively at first; then I thought I had mistaken callousness for strength. Can you blame me? But if it was really strength⁠—if it was only such a mistake as we all make sometimes⁠—it will make me so happy to be friends with you again.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>I tell you I made no mistake. I cured Blenkinsop: was there any mistake there?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>He recovered. Oh, don’t be foolishly proud, doctor. Confess to a failure, and save our friendship. Remember, Sir Ralph gave Louis your medicine; and it made him worse.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>I can’t be your friend on false pretences. Something has got me by the throat: the truth must come out. I used that medicine myself on Blenkinsop. It did not make him worse. It is a dangerous medicine: it cured Blenkinsop: it killed Louis Dubedat. When I handle it, it cures. When another man handles it, it kills⁠—sometimes.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Naively: not yet taking it all in.</sd> Then why did you let Sir Ralph give it to Louis?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>I’m going to tell you. I did it because I was in love with you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Innocently surprised.</sd> In lo⁠—You! elderly man!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Thunderstruck, raising his fists to heaven</sd> Dubedat: thou art avenged! <sd>He drops his hands and collapses on the bench.</sd> I never thought of that. I suppose I appear to you a ridiculous old fogey.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>But surely⁠—I did not mean to offend you, indeed⁠—but you must be at least twenty years older than I am.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Oh, quite. More, perhaps. In twenty years you will understand how little difference that makes.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>But even so, how could you think that I⁠—his wife⁠—could ever think of <em>you</em>⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Stopping her with a nervous waving of his fingers.</sd> Yes, yes, yes, yes: I quite understand: you needn’t rub it in.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>But⁠—oh, it is only dawning on me now⁠—I was so surprised at first⁠—do you dare to tell me that it was to gratify a miserable jealousy that you deliberately⁠—oh! oh! you murdered him.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>
					<prose>I think I did. It really comes to that.</prose>
					<verse>
						<verse-line>Thou shalt not kill, but needst not strive</verse-line>
						<verse-line>Officiously to keep alive.</verse-line>
					</verse>
					<prose>I suppose⁠—yes: I killed him.</prose>
				</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>And you tell me that! to my face! callously! You are not afraid!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>I am a doctor: I have nothing to fear. It is not an indictable offense to call in B. B. Perhaps it ought to be; but it isn’t.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>I did not mean that. I meant afraid of my taking the law into my own hands, and killing you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>I am so hopelessly idiotic about you that I should not mind it a bit. You would always remember me if you did that.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>I shall remember you always as a little man who tried to kill a great one.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Pardon me. I succeeded.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>With quiet conviction.</sd> No. Doctors think they hold the keys of life and death; but it is not their will that is fulfilled. I don’t believe you made any difference at all.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Perhaps not. But I intended to.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Looking at him amazedly: not without pity.</sd> And you tried to destroy that wonderful and beautiful life merely because you grudged him a woman whom you could never have expected to care for you!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Who kissed my hands. Who believed in me. Who told me her friendship lasted until death.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>And whom you were betraying.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>No. Whom I was saving.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Gently.</sd> Pray, doctor, from what?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>From making a terrible discovery. From having your life laid waste.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>How?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>No matter. I have saved you. I have been the best friend you ever had. You are happy. You are well. His works are an imperishable joy and pride for you.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>And you think that is your doing. Oh doctor, doctor! Sir Patrick is right: you do think you are a little god. How can you be so silly? You did not paint those pictures which are my imperishable joy and pride: you did not speak the words that will always be heavenly music in my ears. I listen to them now whenever I am tired or sad. That is why I am always happy.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, now that he is dead. Were you always happy when he was alive?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Wounded.</sd> Oh, you are cruel, cruel. When he was alive I did not know the greatness of my blessing. I worried meanly about little things. I was unkind to him. I was unworthy of him.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Laughing bitterly.</sd> Ha!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>Don’t insult me: don’t blaspheme. <sd>She snatches up the book and presses it to her heart in a paroxysm of remorse, exclaiming</sd> Oh, my King of Men!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>King of Men! Oh, this is too monstrous, too grotesque. We cruel doctors have kept the secret from you faithfully; but it is like all secrets: it will not keep itself. The buried truth germinates and breaks through to the light.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>What truth?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>What truth! Why, that Louis Dubedat, King of Men, was the most entire and perfect scoundrel, the most miraculously mean rascal, the most callously selfish blackguard that ever made a wife miserable.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Unshaken: calm and lovely.</sd> He made his wife the happiest woman in the world, doctor.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>No: by all thats true on earth, he made his <em>widow</em> the happiest woman in the world; but it was I who made her a widow. And her happiness is my justification and my reward. Now you know what I did and what I thought of him. Be as angry with me as you like: at least you know me as I really am. If you ever come to care for an elderly man, you will know what you are caring for.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Kind and quiet.</sd> I am not angry with you any more, Sir Colenso. I knew quite well that you did not like Louis; but it is not your fault: you don’t understand: that is all. You never could have believed in him. It is just like your not believing in my religion: it is a sort of sixth sense that you have not got. And <sd>with a gentle reassuring movement towards him</sd> don’t think that you have shocked me so dreadfully. I know quite well what you mean by his selfishness. He sacrificed everything for his art. In a certain sense he had even to sacrifice everybody⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Everybody except himself. By keeping that back he lost the right to sacrifice you, and gave me the right to sacrifice him. Which I did.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Shaking her head, pitying his error.</sd> He was one of the men who know what women know: that self-sacrifice is vain and cowardly.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Yes, when the sacrifice is rejected and thrown away. Not when it becomes the food of godhead.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>I don’t understand that. And I can’t argue with you: you are clever enough to puzzle me, but not to shake me. You are so utterly, so wildly wrong; so incapable of appreciating Louis⁠—</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Oh! <sd>taking up the Secretary’s list</sd> I have marked five pictures as sold to me.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>They will not be sold to you. Louis’ creditors insisted on selling them; but this is my birthday; and they were all bought in for me this morning by my husband.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>By whom?!!!</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>By my husband.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech><sd>Gabbling and stuttering.</sd> What husband? Whose husband? Which husband? Whom? how? what? Do you mean to say that you have married again?</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech>Do you forget that Louis disliked widows, and that people who have married happily once always marry again?</speech>
			</line>
			<sd-line>The Secretary returns with a pile of catalogues.</sd-line>
			<line>
				<speaker>The Secretary</speaker>
				<speech>Just got the first batch of catalogues in time. The doors are open.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Jennifer</speaker>
				<speech><sd>To Ridgeon, politely.</sd> So glad you like the pictures, Sir Colenso. Good morning.</speech>
			</line>
			<line>
				<speaker>Ridgeon</speaker>
				<speech>Good morning. <sd>He goes towards the door; hesitates; turns to say something more; gives it up as a bad job; and goes.</sd></speech>
